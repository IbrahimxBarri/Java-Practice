/**
 *Write a program that calculates and displays a person's body mass index(BMI). The BMI is often used to determine whether a person 
 * with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height. A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:
 * BMI = Weight * 703 / Height^2

 where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches. The program should display a message indicating whether the person has

 * If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered underweight. If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered overweight.
